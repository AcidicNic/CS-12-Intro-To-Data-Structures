*********
I'm sitting in my room
I'm all alone now
Missing you, every single day
I wish you would say
Baby, I love you
Till I die
All my hopes are gone

The tainted paint that's on the wall
Crumbles and corrodes rumbling softly as it hits the floor
It's time to say goodbye
You said this would never end
Guess you played pretend but it's alright
I know I wasn't good enough
I showed you where it hurts and for what's it worth you made it worse
There's always someone better
I hope you find that guy to make you happy and meanwhile

I'm sitting in my room
I'm all alone now
Missing you, every single day
I wish you would say
Baby, I love you
Till I die
All my hopes are gone
*********
I don't think I'm meant to be with you
I don't wanna make you sad
All the time just feeling bad
Girl, don't make me fall in love with you
I don't think I'm right for you
I'm just disappointing you

Lonely nights like these you just stumble in my head
And I'm wondering what you're doing
And why maybe I'm not dead
The thought of you still kills me
I know I'm a stupid guy
Looking back at my mistakes, I fucked up a million times
I couldn't see the day
I never called somebody mine
Cause every single heartbreak made me lose my fucking mind
I guess I was too blind
Girl, I see that you were right for me
I had to fuck it up, I'm sorry this is not goodbye
I let this so called fame get deep into my head
And I'd end up doing thoughtless things
that I soon would regret
I made you feel special
And I should've felt the same
Cause I had you by my side
How could I have been this way

I don't think I'm meant to be with you
I don't wanna make you sad
All the time just feeling bad
Girl, don't make me fall in love with you
I don't think I'm right for you
I'm just disappointing you

I don't think I'm meant to be with you
I don't wanna make you sad
All the time just feeling bad
Girl, don't make me fall in love with you
I don't think I'm right for you
I'm just disappointing you

I don't think I'm meant to be with you
I don't wanna make you sad
All the time just feeling bad
Girl, don't make me fall in love with you
I don't think I'm right for you
I'm just disappointing you

Time changed
We're different
But my mind still says redundant things
Can I not think?
Will you love this part of me
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you
Keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

Straight up ahead
You'll find a sign that says you can't get by with a lie
But if I stayed away by a thread from the glory path and made my life harder lying bout the stupid shit I say
Then you wouldn't know a single thing about how I feel about you and all those really dumb things people feel
I'll take the bumpy road it'll probably break my legs
As long as I don't show you what's ruining in my head
Funny thing about is you read me pretty well
But you haven't found me yet at the bottom of the well
Annoying you with smoke signals asking you for help
'cause your immediate presence lifts me straight away from hell
Me and Mr. Heart we say the cutest things about you
How you seem unreal and we'd probably die so quick without you
Suffocated from the radiated air around us full of happiness we don't have brightness gone so dark without you girl

Time changed

But I'm okay as long as you
Keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

Family calls me crazy and my friends say I'm degenerate
But you tell me I'm so generous and my self worth isn't hideous
This psychedelic canvas or the person I'm becoming
Went from horror movie on TV to happy ending princess me
Processing the information transferred from your mind to me at light speed like the Falcon from the original Star Wars trilogy
Feeling like a free ol' me when I was 6 and no worries would stop me from reaching the stars million miles away from me
Sick in the head for you and no cure has been discovered like a plague hitting my body except if I fall I'm just fallin' for you
Conscious beyond knowledge alterations are acknowledged, and the beauty you've inflicted is always in its action
Lovely day today, perfect time to open up to you
But I know that you're having fun wouldn't wanna mess this up for you
But I'm happy that you're happy and at least I do that much for you
Always glad you're with me this emotion will be gone before you know

Don't play with me, you broke my heart but I'm also so obsessed with you
I don't know if I love you, I don't know if I hate you
Baby it's time to get out my way, get out my life
I'm so sick of you just playin' games
I'm pretty sure I hate you, I'm pretty sure I love you

After all of this commotion and the bullshit that you did
Cut my body into pieces and just throw me off a bridge, uh
I think it's fair to say, that I'm going insane
More broken day by day, why won't you go away?
You say you hate me but you stay banging my line
Why do you want to break my heart and love me at the same time?
Stupid bitch you came from hell and made me lose my fucking mind
What did I do to deserve this? You just gave me a hard time

They hit me up and told me, that you were with my homie
How could you ever hurt me? I've never been so lonely
Can't take you back oh no no, think that it's time to go go
You left me all on my own

Don't play with me, you broke my heart but I'm also so obsessed with you
I don't know if I love you, I don't know if I hate you
Baby it's time to get out my way, get out my life
I'm so sick of you just playin' games
I'm pretty sure I hate you, I'm pretty sure I love you

You gon' make me take my passion and put it to the side (put it the side)
You was the lady I loved but you ruined my life (you ruined my life)
But you was so pretty that I didn't put up a fight
But you was so petty and I just knew it wasn't right
I've been shit in HD, all of this shit it just ain't me
You been sayin' that you hate me
Then taking it back, and can't face me
I roll a blunt just to face it
And put the bullshit to the side
Made a rollercoaster out of my mattress
How you take a nigga for a fucking ride
I've been trying to put it in the past
Saying that it's old news (old news)
Can't stand the thought of your ass
Deleted your old nudes
Made sure you was solid ain't wanna leave you in the cold boo
I think of the times that spent
It leaving me so foolish (so foolish)

Get carried away and tell me the things you feel
Just don't look away, the feeling here is so real
It's just you and I, floating away in space
Don't worry 'bout them, they'll all go away some day

It's the truth
I gotta find my way back home
I'll look for you
The day that I'm all alone

A knock on my door, I wonder who it could be
The reflection of one, it's everyone here but me
Flew right by my eyes, the essence of company
I'm lost in desire, but now, I can feel at ease

It's the truth
I gotta find my way back home
I'll look for you
The day that I'm all alone
And it's the truth
I gotta find my way back home
I'll look for you
The day that I'm all alone
